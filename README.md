This is a coding quiz using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.

Upon opening the page the user is greeted with a message describing the contents and rules of the quiz. 

Once the user clicks the start button a timer begins, counting down from 150 seconds and the first question pops up on the screen.

 When the user selects an answer and clicks the 'next' button the javascript will calculate if the answer is correct and, if it is, move the user to the next question. If the answer is incorrect 7 seconds are subtracted from the alloted time and the next question is presented. 
 
 If the user runs out of time all unanswered questions are cosidered incorrect and the user is redirected to the results page.

The results page shows the user their score and presents them with the option to save their score to the local server under a set of initials.
